Hi, I'm Thanh-Thuy Nguyen! I have an analytical background in Environmental Health Sciences with a focus on Environmental Science, Chemistry, and Biology, and I'm at the early stages of my career as a business analyst. I am enthusiastic about leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights and currently enhancing my data analysis skills through self-driven projects and practical learning.

Throughout my academic and research experiences, I've developed a solid foundation in scientific data handling, including laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis. These skills fuel my passion for making impactful discoveries and solving environmental and health-related challenges through data.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, particularly with R, as I build and strengthen my skills for future roles. I am committed to expanding my expertise, whether through team collaborations or individual projects, with the goal of uncovering valuable insights and solving complex problems.
